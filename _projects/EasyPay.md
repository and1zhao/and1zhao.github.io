description: A text-messaging bot that automatically completed Venmo transactions based on user intent.
---

During my freshman year of college, my friends and I decided to take part in Cal Hacks 5.0, with no goal in mind other than just to have fun and learn something along the way, as it was most of our first times doing any hackathon nearly as big as this one and we didn't come up with that high of expectation.

While browsing through the sponsor list and potential prizes: one in particular struck our eye: PayPal's. The prompt? Simple. College students often make a large number of daily transactions and we want to give them an overall better experience in splitting transactions with their friends.

In the next 36-ish hours, we set out to do exactly that. By the end, we created a text-based bot that would be able to process individual and group texts, understanding user intent of the message (recipient, dollar amount, and reason for transaction) and then invoking a public Venmo API to automatically send to/charge the given individuals.
