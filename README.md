    <h1>Andy Zhao's Personal Website!</h1>
    Hello and welcome to my website! I've been meaning to a personal website/portfolio for a pretty long time now, and decided to take advantage of the increased time during my Summer 2020 virtual internship to take the time to put this together.
    <br><br>
    I didn't necessarily want to build it up from scratch: I knew surely there must exist tons of open source projects where I could easily plug in my own ideas, and with a recommendation from my friend, happened to stumble upon Jekyll through GitHub Pages. From there, it was a pretty painless process: more info can be found on my website. Hope you enjoy!
