# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:!<br>
I'm currently an incoming junior at UC Berkeley. While I procrastinate on classes, you can find me catching up on the NBA or NFL or obsessing over
what free agent to pick up this week in fantasy football. In fact, I love sports so much my friends and I created a podcast (insert link here)
and would appreciate it if you would give it a listen! Other than that, I'll probably be playing Super Smash Bros. or the newest Nintendo game.
Feel free to contact me in any of the pages at the bottom if you would ever like to talk about any of the previously mentioned!
