- title: SDE Intern, AWS Elemental
  from: May 2020
  to: Present
  description: As an intern on the AWS Elemental Live team, I am building a tool to convert video
               of different formats into industry standard SMPTE-2110 format. This was done
               through intergration of FFmpeg libraries to demux, decode, and scale video input
               into a format suitable for SMPTE-2110. This is a tool that was especially needed for
               engineers on the Live Inputs and Outputs teams, as currently they could only test
               SMPTE-2110 output on very expensive machinery, but now this was possible on their
               own personal laptops. More details of this virtual internship can be found on my blog.

- title: Software Engineer Intern, PayPal
  from: May 2019
  to: August 2019
  description: As an intern at PayPal, there was a need to aggregate support alerts in flagging 
               repeated issues and larger patterns from these alerts. Consequently, I built a 
               full-stack tool to automate pulling in of alerts from PagerDuty and fill out
               appropriate information about the alert. The front end was done through Node.js
               for search functionality, which would be then transferred to Elasticsearch for
               database searching. My tool was put into production by the end of my internship
               and I was in talks with other neighboring teams to implement my tool for their
               teams as well.
